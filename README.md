# CaseLore 

## Background

This project's inital purpose is to meet "Case Management" demands of collaborative investigative projects.

## Project Ideas

-Dashboard should be a series of templ components that self update when prompted to do so.   
-Big challenge is going to be interactivity with local file structure when running on windows.  
-There is a requirement to for outside users to be able to upload files to support cases.  
-Local SQLite data will likely suffice but we should consider backup data.
-Encryption of files might be required.
